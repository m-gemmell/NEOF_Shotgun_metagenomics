During this practical you will use a number of installed programs and scripts. To ensure that the system knows where to look for the scripts, run the following command (ensure this starts with a full stop and a space `. `):

```{bash eval=FALSE}
. useshotgun
```

The `use` scripts in this workshop are custom scripts that set up `mamba` environments. You can look at the above script with `less /usr/local/bin/useshotgun` if you are interested in its contents.

Also, there’s a chance you’re currently not in your home directory, so let’s make sure you are with the following command:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ~
```
