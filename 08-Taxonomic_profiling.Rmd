There are a number of methods for determining the species composition of a metagenomic dataset, but for the purposes of this practical we will use `Kraken2` & `Bracken` (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with KrakEN).  `Kraken2` classifies short DNA with taxonomic labels and is frequently used for metagenomic studies. `Bracken` uses the taxonomic labels assigned by `Kraken2` to compute the abundance of species in a set of DNA sequences.

First, we'll make a new directory for it and move into it, after returning home:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ..
mkdir 3-Taxonomy
cd 3-Taxonomy
```
