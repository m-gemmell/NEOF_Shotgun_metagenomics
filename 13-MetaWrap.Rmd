# MetaWRAP
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/mummy.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

`MetaWRAP` is a very useful program with many tools for metagenome analysis. It contains wrapper scripts, scripts that utilise other programs (e.g. `MEGAHIT`, `CONCOCT`, `Prokka`, etc.). 

`MetaWRAP` can be used to carry out an entire metagenome assembly/co-assembly approach workflow. Its processes include:

- Read QC
- Metagenome assembly
- Taxonomic annotation
- Binning
- Bin refinement
- Bin reassembly
- Bin quantification
- Blobology
- Bin taxonomy classification
- Bin functional annotation

## Tutorial

As an extra for this workshop we have provided the files and an environment on the webVNC to carry out the `MetaWRAP` online tutorial:

https://github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP/blob/master/Usage_tutorial.md

Follow the below instructions to make a new directory and make a symbolic link to the files that you would otherwise have to download in step 0 of the tutorial.

__Note__: The below code section must be carried out outside on another terminal than your `metawrap` terminal.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
mkdir -p ~/MetaWRAP_tut/RAW_READS
cd ~/MetaWRAP_tut
cp /pub39/tea/matthew/NEOF/Shotgun_metagenomics/metawrap/* RAW_READS
```

Now you can carry on with the online tutorial if you wish using your `MetaWRAP` terminal.

__Note__: This has not been fully tested and the environment may not fully work. This is the joys of bioinformatics.
