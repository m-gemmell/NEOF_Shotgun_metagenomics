```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '20%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/start.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

During this practical you will use a number of installed programs and scripts. To ensure that the system knows where to look for the scripts, run the following command:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
source /pub21/sam/metagenomicsWorkshop2019.sh
```

Also, there’s a chance you’re currently not in your home directory, so let’s make sure you are with the following command:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd ~
```
