# Krona plot
```{r, fig.align = 'center',out.width= '15%', echo=FALSE }
knitr::include_graphics(path = "figures/krona.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
``` 

`Krona` is an interactive metagenome species abundance visualisation tool. 

We can use the `Kraken2` report files to create our Krona plots. With the below command we can import our `Kraken2` taxonomy (within the report file) into a `Krona` html.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
ktImportTaxonomy -o kraken2.krona.html *.kreport2
```

`-o` is our output html file, and the final argument `*.kreport2` represents all of our `.kreport2` files in the current directory. The `*` is a wild-card, meaning any characters any number of times. Therefore `*.kreport2` identifies the files `K1.kreport2` `K2.kreport2` and `W1.kreport2`.

You will get a warning that not all taxonomy IDs were found. We will ignore this but in your own future installations this should be addressed with `Krona`'s `updateTaxonomy.sh` command.

Now we can view our interactive chart in a web browser.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
firefox kraken2.krona.html &
```

__Question__: Can you tell which sample looks the most different in terms of bacterial species that are present and absent?
