# Optional task

Carry out all the steps starting from [Multi sample processing](#humannmultisampleprocessing) with the gene families information.

-   Copy the gene families data from `/pub14/tea/nsc206/NEOF/Shotgun_metagenomics/DietGeneFamilies`
-   Ensure you set the `--units` option to `cpm` in the [renormalising data](#humannrenormalise) step.
-   On top of analysing the unstratified data you can also analyse the stratified data.

That completes the non assembly approach to shotgun metagenomic analysis. The next chapters will cover an assembly approach.
